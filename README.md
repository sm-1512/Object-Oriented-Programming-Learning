##  Class

A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the created objects will have.

###  Example: Defining and Using a Class

![Class Example](Images/Classes.png)

In this example:
- A class 'Teacher' is defined with certain attributes and methods.
- An object is created using that class.
- The values of the object are displayed.
- The members of the class are access via the dot operator.
- ### Note: It is important to use the 'public' keyword to ensure that members can be accessed outside the class.
